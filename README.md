# 4InARow
**** Welcome to Game Simulator 4-in-a-row *****
How to play? A grid is shown on the screen (5x5 or 10x10). You play 
against the computer. The player/computer chooses a column to drop a
piece/letter (C for computer and P for player) which will be inserted in
the bottom most square in the column that is free. Connect 4 pieces
horizontally or vertically to win the match. The game can only be a draw 
if ALL the squares are filled and NO ONE has 4-in-a-row

1) EXAMPLE - Assume a 5 x 5 grid, so :
Start Grid

The start grid is always blank! Note how the columns are labelled across
the top so that the player knows what column to pick
Press "ENTER" to continue...

2) let’s say Player 1 chooses column 3

  1    2    3    4    5

 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
|    |    | P  |    |    |
 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 

Press "ENTER" to continue...
3) Now let’s say the computer ALSO chooses column 3 – The bottom square is
not free, so fill the next one up

  1    2    3    4    5  
 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
|    |    |    |    |    |

 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
|    |    |    |    |    |
 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
|    |    | C  |    |    |
 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
|    |    | P  |    |    |
 ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 

Press "ENTER" to continue...

4) To win the game, the Player (or the computer) must get “4 in a row”.
This can be HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL
